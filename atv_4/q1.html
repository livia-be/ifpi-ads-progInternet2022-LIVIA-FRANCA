                Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. This, too, will pass. Peace comes
                from within. Do not seek it without. If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts.
                You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger. The
                smaller your reality, the more convinced you are that you know everything. The
                past has no power over the present moment. If the facts don't fit the theory, change
                the facts.
                You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger.
